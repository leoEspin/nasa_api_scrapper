# React Native Coding Exercise

## 🚀 Steps to Get Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- Expo CLI  
  Install if not already:  
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```
- A mobile device with the Expo Go app **or** an emulator (iOS Simulator/Android Emulator)

---

### 📁 Fork & Clone the Repository

- Repository: [https://github.com/Tekmetric/interview.git](https://github.com/Tekmetric/interview.git)
- Fork the repository to your GitHub account
- Clone your **forked** repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/interview.git
  ```

---

- Initialize a new Expo project in the mobile folder:
  ```bash
  npx create-expo-app react-native-interview --template blank-typescript
  cd react-native-interview
  ```

- Start the project:
  ```bash
  npx expo start
  ```

- Use the **Expo Go app** on your mobile device or an emulator to test the app.

---

## 🎯 Goals

Build a **simple React Native mobile app** using Expo that:

- Fetches data from a **public API of your choice** (e.g., NASA, GitHub, Weather, etc.)
- Displays the data in a **user-friendly** and **visually appealing** way

---

## 📡 Fetch Data

- Pick **any public API** of your choice  
- Fetch a dataset that can be **displayed in a list**

---

## 📱 Display Data

- Create a screen that presents the fetched data using:
  - `ScrollView`, `FlatList`, grid, or something custom
- Display **at least 3 distinct data fields**
- Add a **loading indicator** while fetching data

---

## 🎨 Styling

- Use `StyleSheet` to apply consistent and polished styles
- Customize the UI:
  - Colors, fonts, spacing, or even your own theme
- Include a **header/title section** to give context to the data

---

## ✨ Have Fun

This is an **open-ended exercise** – feel free to:

- Add filtering, sorting, or navigation
- Be creative and show off your skills!

> No need to implement authentication, registration, or login features.

---

## 💡 Considerations

- Keep a **clean code structure**
- Handle errors gracefully
- Focus on **smooth user experience**
- Use **functional components and hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
- Get creative with your UI!

---

## ✅ Submitting Your Coding Exercise

- Once completed, create a **pull request** into `Tekmetric/interview` under the `mobile` folder.
- Include a brief **README** in your submission with:
  - Instructions to run the app
  - The API you chose and why
  - Any additional notes about your implementation or creative additions
